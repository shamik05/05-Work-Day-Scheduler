# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple day planner app to save tasks by timeslots. By default, it has been setup with the work time from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Users have the option of specifying their own work times even into next day. Time slots are rendered in 1 hour blocks where users can enter a set of tasks and save them. Also, time blocks are colour coded to reflect past, present and future timeblocks in the grey, red, and green respectively with passive refreshing every minute. The save functionality has been implemented through localstorage and persists upon browser refresh. Moment api has been used for time functionality and manipulation. Finally, the app is hosted on github [here](https://shamik05.github.io/Homework-05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler/).
