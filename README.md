# Homework-05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

This is the 5th homework assignment creating a daily planner. Instructions are in the instructions.md. It was suppose to have only have timeslots from 9AM to 5PM. I added functionality to include any ranged timeslots specified by the user. It was built with the Moment api and efforts have been made to hardcode as little as possible. 
Here is image of my functioning app and the link. Enjoy
